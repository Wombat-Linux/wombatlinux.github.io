                About Wombat Linux
            </h2>
            <p>
                Wombat Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution that can run on all
                types of (for now, x86_64) systems. It relies on musl-libc over glibc
                and replaces the usual GNU Coreutils with Suckless Base. Bash is included,
                however it is not the default shell, instead, ZSH is used as the main
                shell of choice.
                <br />
                Wombat Linux, like other distributions, supports X11 and allows for the
                installation of dwm on top, with XFCE and KDE being planned packages.
                <br />
                <b>How small is it REALLY?</b>
                <br>
                Currently the minimal ISO is &lt; 300 MB, however it is has some artifacts
                from testing, so an even smaller version will be available on v1.0 release.
                The development environment (which is basically the same system but with a
                lot of tools like GCC and the necessary tools to build more software) is
                around 1.7 GB.

                Philosophy
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are two main philosophies of Wombat Linux:
                <ol class="list-with-space">
                    <li>
                        "light, yet powerful", or
                        rather, to stay minimalist, but allow for expansion into more
                        powerful use cases.
                        <br/>
                        The system by itself, at base installation, will use as little
                        system resources as possible. It is the user's choice to expand
                        on that.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Community-driven development: as in creation and implementation
                        of software in a community focused manner, mainly on <a
                            href="https://github.com/wombatlinux">GitHub</a> and
                        other project collaboration sites.

                Versioning
            </h2>
            <p>
                Wombat Linux is rolling release. The main ISOs however, will
                not be updated as frequently as the base system. The installer,
                named <code>wombatinstaller</code>, will install the latest
                packages, and thus will be the reasoning for the lack of updates.
                The ISOs will only be updated as fast as the installer or package
                manager are updated, as those are the only software that are
                required to use the ISOs for their intended purposes.
